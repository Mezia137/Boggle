# Boggle Algorithm

Boggle Algorithm is a project aimed at implementing a word search algorithm for the game of Boggle. While the project does not include a graphical user interface (GUI), its primary focus lies in the efficient word search algorithm.

## Introduction

Boggle is a word game where players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters on a grid. The objective is to find as many words as possible within a limited time frame.

This project focuses on the algorithmic aspect of Boggle, specifically the efficient search for words within the grid.

## Features

- Implements a highly efficient word search algorithm for Boggle grids.
- Utilizes a search tree data structure that stores all words from the dictionary.
- Parses through the grid to find all valid words.
- Provides a solid foundation for building a full-fledged Boggle game with a graphical user interface.

## Usage

To run the Boggle Algorithm, execute the `boggle_algo.py` script.

```bash
python boggle_algo.py
```
## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
